# letterboxed
This project was created during my summer 2025 CSEd internship. I created a program which simulates a game identical to LetterBoxed by NYT Games. 
Users are given a box with 3 unique letters on each side of the box, and they must connect those letters to each other to form words. The basic goal of the game is utilize all letters.
The more challenging goals of the game include utilizing the least amount of words possible and repeating letters as little as possible. Of course, users can also have other personal goals in mind.
This program is written in C and utilizes the linked list data structure to let users build words. Since this was created in the thought of a CS2 course, students would be expected to build this functionality on their own if presented this as a programming project.
The program itself is slit between different modalities, including 'playMode' and 'solverMode'. The solverMode is what separates this program from the original game, as it lets users determine all possible words that can be created given the puzzle's rules and letters. 
Additionally, there are command-line arguments to set certain parameters for the game and an ascii user interface to mimic the look of the original.
In the image below, you can see some of the beginning message printed to the user, showcasing the settings based on certain command line arguments.
